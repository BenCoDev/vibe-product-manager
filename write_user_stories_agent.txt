# Why

- Coaches need to understand how a learner answered each question in order to give relevant feedback and adapt their support.

# What

**AACoach**, **When** I open the detail panel for a learner, **I see** their submitted answers and expected answers, **So that** I can assess their understanding and identify misconceptions

**Details**

- A final evaluations is done by integrating “exercice” granules
- This exercice granules are of the type: Simple question / Ordering / Categorizing / Image
- For each item, we should see:
    - if user had the correct answer or not
    - which answer the user entered
    - if answer is incorrect - what is the correct answer

# User journey

Use case: when learner has **wrong** answers

Use case: when learner has **right** answers

# How

*Possible strategy/technical plan on how to do this*

# Other resources

- *Any other resources — if across project, use the Synced block*

# Acceptance criteria

- [ ]  Given I open a learner’s evaluation attempt, when the panel loads, then I see all granules in vertical order
- [ ]  Given a granule is a simple question, when I view the learner’s response, then I see their selected answer and whether it was correct
- [ ]  Given a granule is a simple question, when I scroll below the response, then I see the expected answer under “Réponse attendue”
- [ ]  Given a granule is an ordering question, when I view the learner’s response, then I see their ordered list and the correct order below
- [ ]  Given a granule is a classifier, when I view the learner’s response, then I see items placed in categories with visual feedback for correctness
- [ ]  Given a granule is a classifier, when I scroll down, then I see the expected category assignment in a dedicated block
- [ ]  Given a granule is an image analysis question, when I view the learner’s response, then I see their selected zone and the correct target zone
